## Flappy Bird AI

  This repository is a Pytorch DQN implementation with Expecimax algorithm making decision. The work referred to [1](https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird), [2](https://github.com/uvipen/Flappy-bird-deep-Q-learning-pytorch) and [3](https://github.com/xmfbit/DQN-FlappyBird). Thanks!



#### Usage

1. Install all the requirements by

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Train the network by

   `python -u dqn_ai.py --m train`

3. Test the network by 

   `python -u dqn_ai.py --m test`

  You are able to modify the training parameters in start() of dqn_ai.py.
